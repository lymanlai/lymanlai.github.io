#PACKAGES
Everything in mean.io is a package and when extending mean with custom functionality make sure you create your own package and do not alter the core packages.
There are two types of packages:
*Custom Packages* are generated by the mean scaffolder and contain most of your application logic. Custom packages are found in /packages/custom and can be published as a contrib package for use by other developers.
*Contrib Packages* are installed by the mean installer and are found at /packages/contrib. Contrib packages are “plug and play”.
