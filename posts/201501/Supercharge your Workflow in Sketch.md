1. Efficiently Rename Layers
    Select a layer. Hit ⌘ + R. Start typing. Hit Enter to save.
    Bonus Tip: After renaming your first layer, press Tab to go to the next layer (or Shift + Tab for the previous), then hit ⌘ + R to rename it.
2. Export All Artboards
    Hit ⌘ + Shift + E. Fine tune with options in the sidebar.
    Bonus Tip: You can export an artboard to a subfolder such as “Home” by prefixing the artboard name with “home/”
3. Conveniently Measure Distance between Objects
    Select an object you want to measure. Hold ⌥, then mouse over a target object.
    Bonus Tip: Holding ⌥ without mousing over another object will show you its position relative to the entire artboard, so you can easily tell, for example, how many pixels the object is from the bottom of an iPhone.
    Bonus Bonus Tip: If you can’t seem to measure an object despite hovering over it, try holding ⌘ with ⌥.
4. Quickly Clone a Color
    Ctrl + C.
5. Zoom all The Way into a Layer
    ⌘ + 2.  An alternative way to do this is to hold Z, then click and drag an area you want to zoom into all the way.
6. Zoom to Actual Size/100%
    ⌘ + 0
    Bonus Tip: ⌘ + 1 will zoom out to show all your artboards at once, to giving you an overview.
7. Select Multiple Layers
    Left Click and Drag over the layers you want to select.
    Bonus Tip: If you can’t seem to select the layers, they might be inside a group. Try holding ⌘ while dragging to remedy this.
8. Create Layer Group
    ⌘ + G
9. Bonus Tips
    ⌘ + Shift + H to hide or unhide a layer/layergroup
    ⌘ and + to zoom in steps (100%, 200%, 400% etc). Conversely, zoom out with ⌘ and -
    Enter to start editing an object. Alternatively, pressing Esc will back out of editing.
    ⌘ + Shift + L to lock a layer/layergroup
    ⌘ + B to make text bold
    F to toggle fill on/off
