#All About Ionic

##Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps.
##We built Ionic because we strongly believed that HTML5 would rule on mobile over time, exactly as it has on the desktop.
##The bulk of an Ionic app will be written in HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Eager developers might also dig down into the native layer with custom Cordova plugins or native code, but it's not necessary to get a great app.

#Installation

```
  sudo npm install -g cordova
  sudo npm install -g ionic
  ionic start todo blank
  cd todo && ls
  ionic platform add ios
  ionic platform add android
  ionic build ios
  ionic emulate ios
  #for android, do not use emulate as it just toooo slow!
  #I connect it with an android phone, then use this command to run!
  ionic run android

```

# Starting your app
