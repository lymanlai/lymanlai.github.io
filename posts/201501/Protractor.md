# [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/)


1. npm install -g protractor  #install
2. webdriver-manager update   #update to download necessary binaries
3. webdriver-manager start
    This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test will send requests to this server to control a local browser. You can see information about the status of the server at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.

##Test Like a User
Protractor is built on top of WebDriverJS, which uses native events and browser-specific drivers to interact with your application as a user would.
##For AngularJS Apps
Protractor supports Angular-specific locator strategies, which allows you to test Angular-specific elements without any setup effort on your part.
##Automatic Waiting
You no longer need to add waits and sleeps to your test. Protractor can automatically execute the next step in your test the moment the webpage finishes pending tasks, so you donâ€™t have to worry about waiting for your test and webpage to sync.
