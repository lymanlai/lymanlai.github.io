As we now use bigger fonts everywhere, we have to reduce the font weight because otherwise it would steal too much attention from the rest of the content.

#The rules of good typography
Letâ€™s look at these [5 rules of good typography](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) and apply them to modern design for mobile and for Websites.
    1. Your body text is everything
        Pick a font that looks good in the body text. Avoid system fonts. When in doubt, pick a readable font that is both clean and comfortable. Helvetica Neue Light, Avenir Next, Proxima Nova, Museo Sans and Open Sans are some of my favorites.
    2. Typography that stays fit
        At 24-36px, use Regular. At 36-48px, use Light, at 48-64px, use Thin and at 64px+, use Ultra Thin. Notice that in each of the scale, the text remains readable while looking clean and sophisticated.
    3. Line height that breathe
        The line height should be between 120% to 145% of the font size.
        The top example has a line height that equals the font size (100%). At the bottom, I applied a 145% scale. The difference is substantial. Now, multiply that quantity of words read by 10 and you get an idea of how frustrating it can be to have to read such condensed text.
    4. 45-90 characters per line rule
    5. Use your font wisely
    6. Serif and Sans-Serif
