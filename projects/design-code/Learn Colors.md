#Get started
First, I suggest reading this [guide](http://www.rocket-design.fr/color-template/) about colors. It explains the theory behind colors.
1. Primary, secondary and tertiary colors
2. Monochrome colors
    The most common scenario is to have one main color and apply a 10-50% white or black layer on top.
3. Analogous colors
4. Complementary colors
5. Neutral tones
6. Hue, Saturation, Brightness and Alpha

#Using an image's colors
1. The manual way
2. Using Adobe’s Kuler

#The neutral palettes
1. The blue palette
2. The gray palette
3. The custom palette

#Light and Dark UI

1. Guidelines for Light UI
  1. The content should be lighter than the background. Objects in focus are usually better lit than the background.
  2. Don’t overuse colors. They really grab your attention. Use colors to give importance to buttons and hightlighted states.
  3. Avoid average colors. 90-100% white is usually the best range.
2. Guidelines for Dark UI
  1. Don’t use absolute black. It’s very hard to see the details in pitch black and the contrast can be too high against white.
  2. If you must use black, make sure to have variations of dark gray to alleviate the high contrast..
  3. Avoid grays when using blue. Dark blue complements blue better than gray.
