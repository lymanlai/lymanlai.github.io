[The iOS 8 Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/)

#Core Philosophies

1. Deference: Your content should be the hero, everything else is secondary.
    1. Simplify
        Your user interface should be stripped down to the core aesthetic. Every time you add an element, ask yourself "is this necessary?". Unless your app is a game or a specific theme, temper your use of heavy textures, 3D effects and multiple shadows. Instead, focus on functional colors, harmonious gradients, and beautiful typography.
    2. Maximize content
        The content should take the whole screen, giving maximum space to its inner elements. Avoid multiple containers and maximize the scrolling areas, which will allow more room for interactions.
    3. Colors
        Use a prominent color to show that an element is tappable or that itâ€™s highlighted.
    4. Typography is content
    5. Negative space
        The less you see, the more you can focus on few things at once.
    6. Icon states
        The icons for navigation have 2 states: outline and fill mode.
2. Clarity
    1. Make the text readable
        In Retina, typography should have a minimum size of 22px. The optimal size for reading is around 32px.
    2. Use obvious icons
        Once you use an icon, don't re-use another variation of the same icon elsewhere. That will confuse your users. Likewise, don't use generic texts such as "Back" or "Submit", instead be specific and write "Back to Home" and "Sign up a new account".
    3. Descriptive screens
    4. Meaning in colors
        Use red, green, blue and neutral tones wisely to indicate destructive actions, affirmative actions, links and inactive states respectively.
3. Depth
    1. Transitional interface
         Every screen transitions from one to another. The home screen zooms into a folder, then zooms into an app.
    2. Blurred background

#Make it delightful
What's not really mentioned in the guidelines are 3 things that can make your app really stand out: animations, gestures and sounds. It's really easy to go overboard with them, so use with moderation.

1. Animations
    Animation not only serves to transition from one screen to another, it also adds playfulness and excitement to your design. It also brings importance to an element that would otherwise be ignored.
2. Gestures
3. Sounds

#Three rules
If you are to ignore all else, you must at least consider these 3 important rules to iOS design: consider the touch interface, make the text readable and optimize for the iPhone 4.

1. Design for touch
    Buttons should be easily tappable. In Retina, their sizes should be between 60-120px tall. The optimal height is 88px. On rare occasions, set 44px for links inside texts, but use cautiously -- they're hard to tap. Even text buttons have a tappable zone of at least 60px. Width should be at least that of the height.
2. Readability
    In Retina, typography should have a minimum size of 22px. The optimal font size for reading is around 32px. Use a line-height of 120-140% to make the reading experience even better.

#Starting templates
The best way to learn a new craft is to reverse-engineer works from others. These templates are not only useful for study but also to re-use and customize, so you don't have to start from scratch and open the possibility for errors. As you'll get more comfortable with design, you will be able to go crazy.

1. iOS 8 template for Sketch
    An excellent starting point is to download [iOS 8 template](http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/iphone-sketch-app/) for Sketch. It will give you most of the UI elements found in iOS 8 that you can freely use in your designs. As you use this, it is important to get comfortable with the size of each element such as the header, buttons, dialogs, etc.

    Designing for iOS 8 and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sizes is a relatively new topic, so this will be continuously updated.
