#Keyboard Shortcuts
1. Essential Shortcuts
    This is a list of the most essential shortcuts to learn. Because I do these actions hundreds of times a day, I find it important to remember them by heart. Please note that I didn't include the usual suspects of Copy, Paste and Zoom.
      Rectangle R
      Text  T
      Show Distance to Other Layers Alt
      Group Layers  Command + G
      Ungroup Layers  Command + Shift + G
      Duplicate Alt + Drag
      Presentation Mode Command + .
2. Custom Shortcuts
    Some functions don't have a shortcut attached. Yet, I use them all the time. In order to set your own shortcuts, you have to go to System Preferences / Keyboards / Shortcuts / App Shortcuts and add app-specific shortcuts. You have to match the name of the command.
      Make Grid...  Command + Shift + M
      Round to Nearest Pixel Edge Command + Shift + R
      Paste and Match Style Command + Shift + B
      Create Symbol Command + Shift + J
      Create Shared Style Command + Shift + K
      Paste in Place  Command + Shift + V
3. Full list of Shortcuts
    There are over 40 Keyboard shortcuts in Sketch. If you'd like to learn all of them, you should pay a visit to Bohemian Coding's [manual](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/15-shortcuts/) or to [sketchshortcuts.com](http://sketchshortcuts.com/).

#Resources
The best way to learn Sketch is to download other people's work. The community is growing at a rapid pace. [Sketchappsources](http://sketchappsources.com/) and [Sketch Resources](http://sketchresources.com/) are some of my favorite places to find user-submitted Sketch designs.
