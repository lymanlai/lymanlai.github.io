#Collecting Inspiration
1. Collecting Designs
    [Ember](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ember-screenshot-annotate/id402456742?mt=12&uo=4&at=1l3vnyT) is the most efficient tool that I've found for collecting images. It has a Dribbble plugin that allows you to quickly save the images to your library. You can even subscribe to other RSS feeds such as [500px](http://500px.com/) and [The Dieline](http://www.thedieline.com/).
2. Collecting Colors
    On Dribbble, you can browse and save great color schemes.Then, you can browse colors from a design that inspired you.
3. Collecting UI Templates
    An important part of your design studies is to download other people's work and analyze the layers. There are a number of resources you can find for Sketch. My favorites are [Sketch App Sources](http://www.sketchappsources.com/) and [Sketch Resources](http://sketchresources.com/).
